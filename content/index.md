hi! i'm phoebe (she/her), a game designer and electronics maker somewhere in between brooklyn and dublin. in
the past i've designed tabletop rpgs, and currently i'm working on a game for
the [playdate](https://play.date/) (more info on the blog soon). i sometimes
build keyboards (the computer kind), guitar pedals, lights, standing desk
controllers, and anything else i can put on a
[perma-proto](https://www.adafruit.com/product/571).

as a day job, i'm a senior software engineer on the enterprise team at webflow.
previously i worked at glitch building the code editor and other developer
tools, and before that i was architecting a new website in react for autozone.

trans rights are human rights, black lives matter, abortion is healthcare, and
fascism is a loser ideology.
