title: i'm moving!

so, i, somehow, got a job in dublin. tbh, i didn't think it would actually happen. i've _vaguely_ tried
getting a job outside of the u.s. for a few years at this point. by this i mean i'd occassionally apply
to a couple job openings, have all of those applications instantly rejected (probably due to me needing
a visa), then give up. this was actually the first time i'd even made it past the recruiter screening
for a role outside of the u.s., and i spent the every step thinking "yeah, that's probably the furthest
i'm going to make it in the interview process".
