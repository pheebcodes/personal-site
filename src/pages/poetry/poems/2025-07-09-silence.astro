<Poem title={title} date={date}>
	<pre>finding silence in swaying
space between        trees
or being taken under water
until sound     disappears</pre>

	<pre>i want to be held      deeply
  by gentle hands      loved
                       rather than     dreaming
                                       just to grasp    shores</pre>
</Poem>
