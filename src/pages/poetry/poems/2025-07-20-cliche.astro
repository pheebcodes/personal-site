<Poem title={title} date={date} draft={draft}>
	<pre>i think most writers have received a similar comment
<i>you should try using ai to write your poems</i>
no not that one though that one also fucking sucks
<i>you must be so in tune with your emotions</i></pre>

	<pre>which couldn't be further from the truth
though i fail to say that in the moment
i smile and laugh and say <i>maybe</i> as if
there's any chance in hell i could</pre>

	<pre>deliver any clarity to any thing i've ever
felt when i express myself by one way encrypting
emotions using block cipher tossing the key
taping the result to your door eye-level and running</pre>

	<pre>the truth is i can't name an emotion
i toil over every charged word i've penned-
said with the hesitation of being strung
up with a thousand tiny fishhooks piercing</pre>

	<pre>my skin to carbon-fiber strands
tensile strength much greater than flesh
god so much greater than flesh
with someone at the winch cranking</pre>

	<pre>disappointment every time i convey cogent thought
or use a sentence that isn't embarassingly run-on
because i love to hear myself
fucking yap</pre>

	<pre>no the real truth is that i'm terrified of showing
my soft pink underbelly with short thick lines
scars that despite what i might be implying
are from a laparoscopic surgery over six years ago</pre>

	<pre>but i beg for the day i can again speak freely
<i>i'm so fucking angry right now</i> outside
musty narrow booths with some <b><Shift options={['man', 'pedophile', 'fucker', 'priest', 'asshole']} frequency={2000} /></b>
flip side obligated to forgive me</pre>

	<pre>but for now these words are all i have</pre>
</Poem>
