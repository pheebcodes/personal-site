	<pre>i think most writers have received a similar comment
<i>you should try using ai to write your poems</i>
no not that one though that one also fucking sucks
<i>you must be so in tune with your emotions</i></pre>

	<pre>which couldn't be further from the truth
though i fail to say that in the moment
i smile and laugh and say <i>maybe</i> as if
there's any chance in hell i could</pre>

	<pre>deliver any clarity to any thing i've ever
felt when i express myself one way encrypting
emotions using block cipher tossing key
stapling result to the skin of someone</pre>

	<pre>who couldn't give a fuck's door
ringing the bell and running dropping test
subjects of today's obscene labyrinth
praying they make out alive but keeping secret</pre>

	<pre>the truth is i can't name an emotion
i toil over every charged word i've penned-
said with the hesitation of being strung
up with a thousand tiny fishhooks piercing</pre>

	<pre>my skin to carbon-fiber strands
tensile strength much greater than flesh
god so much greater than flesh
someone (likely myself) at the winch cranking</pre>

	<pre>disappointment every time i convey cogent thought
(fully able to describe their emotions)
                          [my projections]
or use a sentence that isn't run-on
because i love to hear myself
fucking yap</pre>

	<pre>no the real truth is that i'm terrified
showing soft pink underbelly with short thick lines
scars that despite what i might be implying
were from a laparoscopic surgery over six years ago</pre>

	<pre>but i beg again for the gall i can say freely
<i>i'm fucking angry right now</i> outside
musty narrow booths with some <b><Shift options={['man', 'pedo', 'fucker', 'priest', 'asshole']} /></b>
flip side who's obligated by god to forgive me</pre>

	<pre>TODO: fix this up, feels a bit... cliché
or at least he's required to now because
we both know i'd be a broke bitch
if we still had to pay for that shit
and i'm tired of saying hail marys</pre>
