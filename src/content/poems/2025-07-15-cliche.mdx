<pre>i think most writers have received a similar comment
<i>you should try using ai to write your poems</i>
no not that one though that one also fucking sucks
<i>you must be so in tune with your emotions</i></pre>

<pre>which couldn't be further from the truth
though i fail to say that in the moment
i smile and laugh and say <i>maybe</i> as if
there's any chance in hell i could deliver</pre>

<pre>any clarity to any thing i've ever felt
when the only way i know how to express myself
is to encrypt emotions using a one-way block
cipher and staple the result to someone</pre>

<pre>who couldn't give a fuck's door
ring the bell and run because communicating
my feelings directly would require me
to show my victims the soft pink</pre>

<pre>underbelly scarred with six thick lines
that despite what i might be implying was
actually from a laparoscopic surgery to
remove my gallbladder six some-odd years ago</pre>

<pre>but the truth is i can't name an emotion
instead i toil over every charged word i've penned-
said with the trepidation of being strung
up with a thousand tiny fishhooks piercing</pre>

<pre>my skin attached to carbon-fiber strands
tensile strength much greater than flesh
god so much greater than flesh
and someone at the winch cranking it up</pre>

<pre>every time i convey a cogent thought
or use a sentence that isn't run-on
because i love to hear myself
fucking yap</pre>

<pre>and i beg for the day i can freely say
<i>i'm fucking angry right now</i> outside
of musty narrow booths with some <b><Shift options={['man', 'pedo', 'fucker', 'priest', 'asshole']} /></b>
on the other side who's required to forgive me</pre>

<pre>or at least he's required to now because
we both know i'd be a broke bitch
if we still had to pay for that shit
and i'm tired of saying hail marys</pre>
