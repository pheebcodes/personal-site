> not super mobile friendly atm... fixing _eventually_.

<pre>i led you onto a train
southbound connolly station
to a village by a sea
quieter than places we're used to
along roads just fitting
narrow buses single file</pre>

<pre>we bought each other claddagh
rings with pause to see the other
wear theirs first preventing mistake
the rings remained unboxed
silver for me gold for you
a decision deferred and looming</pre>

<pre>checked into a hotel cheap and small
fulfilling a promise you made
teaching an art unafforded to me
in my youth <i>shit it's easier
to do on yourself in the mirror</i>
but you attempt it anyways
and i love the look</pre>

<pre>the streets were too dim to find
the pub we were pulled into
with little contest we watched
finding time between songs to hear
your <i>exhale</i> as if you held breath
waiting for the song to end again</pre>

<pre>we made our way to the beach
dark down narrow stairs
into the ocean's alcove with sand
filling our shoes removed
i entered the water cold
surprising us both i missed
the begging of the irish sea
(name contested) to pull me deep</pre>

<pre>telling me your last night's dream
for hearing nothing i focused intense
on the gentle movement of your lips
the <i>soft pressure of your breath</i>
passing folds forming symphonies
i inevitably failed to hear
but cherished the sound of</pre>

<pre>lying back in the sand staring
at nothing you point declaring it
<i>romulan space</i> but i didn't believe
you would know better than i
about a show i'm still watching
for the first time i notice
the lack of space between our ships
colliding endless and beautiful</pre>
