hi! i'm phoebe (she/her), an artist and electronics maker in dublin. in the past
i've designed tabletop rpgs, and currently i'm working on a game for the
[playdate](https://play.date/) (more info on the blog soon) and a poetry zine. i
sometimes build keyboards (the computer kind), guitar pedals, lights, standing
desk controllers, and anything else i can put on a
[perma-proto](https://www.adafruit.com/product/571).

as a day job, i'm a technical lead at hubspot. i was most recently a senior
software engineer on the enterprise team at webflow. before that i worked at
glitch building the code editor and other developer tools.

trans rights are human rights, black lives matter, abortion is healthcare, and
fascism is a loser ideology.
